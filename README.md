8 Week SQL Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the 8 Week SQL Challenge started by Danny Ma through the Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program. The challenge consists of 8 different SQL case studies, each designed to enhance your SQL skills through practical, real-world scenarios.
Case Studies

The repository is organized into 8 directories, one for each case study. 

Each directory contains the following:

•	ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram): A visual representation of the database schema used in the case study.

•	Dataset: The Dataset which is used to create the table and insert the data.

•	Questions: The list of questions provided for the case study.


•	Answers: My solutions to the questions, written in SQL.
